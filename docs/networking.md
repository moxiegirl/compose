# Networking in Compose

> **Note:** Compose's networking support is experimental, and must be explicitly enabled with the `docker-compose --x-networking` flag.

Compose sets up a single default
[network](/engine/reference/commandline/network_create.md) for your app. Each
container for a service joins the default network and is both *reachable* by
other containers on that network, and *discoverable* by them at a hostname
identical to the container name.

> **Note:** Your app's network is given the same name as the "project name", which is based on the name of the directory it lives in. See the [Command line overview](reference/docker-compose.md) for how to override it.

For example, suppose your app is in a directory called `myapp`, and your `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:

    web:
      build: .
      ports:
        - "8000:8000"
    db:
      image: postgres

When you run `docker-compose --x-networking up`, the following happens:

1. A network called `myapp` is created.
2. A container is created using `web`'s configuration. It joins the network
`myapp` under the name `myapp_web_1`.
3. A container is created using `db`'s configuration. It joins the network
`myapp` under the name `myapp_db_1`.

Each container can now look up the hostname `myapp_web_1` or `myapp_db_1` and
get back the appropriate container's IP address. For example, `web`'s
application code could connect to the URL `postgres://myapp_db_1:5432` and start
using the Postgres database.

Because `web` explicitly maps a port, it's also accessible from the outside world via port 8000 on your Docker host's network interface.

> **Note:** in the next release there will be additional aliases for the
> container, including a short name without the project name and container
> index. The full container name will remain as one of the alias for backwards
> compatibility.

## Updating containers

If you make a configuration change to a service and run `docker-compose up` to update it, the old container will be removed and the new one will join the network under a different IP address but the same name. Running containers will be able to look up that name and connect to the new address, but the old address will stop working.

If any containers have connections open to the old container, they will be closed. It is a container's responsibility to detect this condition, look up the name again and reconnect.

## Configure how services are published

By default, containers for each service are published on the network with the
container name. If you want to change the name, or stop containers from being
discoverable at all, you can use the `container_name` option:

    web:
      build: .
      container_name: "my-web-application"

## Links

Docker links are a one-way, single-host communication system. They should now be considered deprecated, and you should update your app to use networking instead. In the majority of cases, this will simply involve removing the `links` sections from your `docker-compose.yml`.

## Specifying the network driver

By default, Compose uses the `bridge` driver when creating the app’s network. The Docker Engine provides one other driver out-of-the-box: `overlay`, which implements secure communication between containers on different hosts (see the next section for how to set up and use the `overlay` driver). Docker also allows you to install [custom network drivers](/engine/extend/plugins_network.md).

You can specify which one to use with the `--x-network-driver` flag:

    $ docker-compose --x-networking --x-network-driver=overlay up

## Multi-host networking

(TODO: talk about Swarm and the overlay driver)

## Custom container network modes

Compose allows you to specify a custom network mode for a service with the `net` option - for example, `net: "host"` specifies that its containers should use the same network namespace as the Docker host, and `net: "none"` specifies that they should have no networking capabilities.

If a service specifies the `net` option, its containers will *not* join the app’s network and will not be able to communicate with other services in the app.

If *all* services in an app specify the `net` option, a network will not be created at all.
